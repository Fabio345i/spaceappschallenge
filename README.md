## Core Features

### üåê Interactive 3D Globe

Powered by [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/), the globe lets you explore weather data anywhere on Earth. Search for cities, view precise administrative boundaries, and navigate smoothly between locations. Click on disaster alerts to instantly fly to affected areas.

### üìà Historical Climate Data

Access over 40 years of weather records from [NASA's POWER API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/). View temperature trends, precipitation patterns, humidity levels, wind speeds, and atmospheric pressure for any location worldwide.

### üîÆ Predictive Weather Models

Machine learning algorithms analyze historical patterns to forecast future conditions. The system examines 20 years of data for similar dates, calculates climate trends, and predicts weather with measurable confidence scores:

### üåßÔ∏è Hourly Precipitation Breakdown

Get detailed rainfall predictions for four time periods:
- **Night** (00:00 - 06:00)
- **Morning** (06:00 - 12:00)
- **Afternoon** (12:00 - 18:00)
- **Evening** (18:00 - 00:00)

### üö® Real-Time Disaster Monitoring

Live ticker displaying global natural disasters from [NASA's EONET](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) database:
- Earthquakes with magnitude and location
- Hurricanes and tropical storms
- Wildfires and affected areas
- Floods, droughts, and severe weather

Click any alert to navigate directly to the disaster location on the globe.

## How Predictions Work

### Temperature Forecasting

1. **Historical Analysis**: Gather 41 years of data for the target date (with configurable day window)
2. **Trend Calculation**: Compare recent years vs. historical average to identify climate trends
3. **Future Adjustment**: Apply trend to predict future temperatures
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate reliability using exponential decay formula

```
confidence = 80 √ó exp(-0.001 √ó days_into_future)
```

### Precipitation Distribution

Hourly rainfall predictions use historical time-of-day patterns:
1. Calculate predicted daily total
2. Analyze historical distribution across time periods
3. Apply proportional distribution to predicted total
4. Add natural variability based on historical patterns
